# Weather-Forecasting
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to forecasting 7-day weather conditions for major Australian cities using Random Forest models. The dashboard visualizes temperature predictions made by both Random Forest Regressor (RFR) models and weather code predictions made by Random Forest Classification (RFC) models, and compares them with expert-provided forecasts. The primary aim is to assess the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in predicting temperature and weather codes, while offering an interactive and user-friendly interface for visualisation.
